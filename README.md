## explFORlife  
game of my fantasy

### next steps to do:
- generated random background/world in web worker (noise function)
- comunication between controller and game (2 separate devices)
- etc

### actually
right now i think like this, i will be making more iteration of this game, and on each one i want try and learn something what helps me make better next iteration, for now my first version of game will be generated world with forests and lakes, player will be able to walks on meadow only for now, there would be som egenerated stuff around, i want to make really good generated world, so that is the main goal of this version, make good-looking detailed world what i after generation of noise function output will process and modify as i want like transitions, details, borders, etc. So i don't think for now with interactions with near environment or player abilities.
Of course i have in my head even plot and storytelling ready but one step at the time...  
i think i will be had three versions, first one aimed on environent mainly, second on interactions of player, environment and maybe more stuff around with parts of storytelling and the final one what will be absolutely different from the previous ones, but knowladges from them will help me to make it works
